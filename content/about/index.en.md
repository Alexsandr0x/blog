## Hello! You can call me Alex :D

My name is Alexsandro, but I prefer Alex.

I'm a tech guy interested in a lot of things, but mainly data related stuff. Currently a mid-senior data engineer and trying to improve myself in other areas such as software architecture.

Other tech interests rely on robotics, 3D printing, python language and event driven systems.

## Robots playing Soccer!

If you are interest in multi-robotics systems, you can learn a little more with my projects in [Neon Robotics Team](https://github.com/project-neon) at Federal University of ABC!

## My teachings

I'm also teacher on my spare time, mainly focused on present programing and data analytics for noobies in these topics.

My most recently experiences as teacher was:
* [NÃºcleo de Tecnologia do MTST](https://nucleodetecnologia.com.br/) teaching HTML, CSS and Portugol for free to the community.

* [Sirius Education](https://www.sirius.education/) creating content and mentoring students in topics such as Python, SQL and other data science capabilities.
