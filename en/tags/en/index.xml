You can call me Alex :D My name is Alexsandro, but I prefer Alex.
I&amp;rsquo;m a tech guy interested in a lot of things, but mainly data related stuff. Currently a mid-senior data engineer and trying to improve myself in other areas such as software architecture.
Other tech interests rely on robotics, 3D printing, python language and event driven systems.
